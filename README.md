# ERAU Prescott VEX Robotics Club Coding Resources

This repository contains various files that serve as useful resources for the
programming team, including the club style guide, git policies, and
.clang-format file.
Other important files will be added as they are created.

This repository is meant to be a unified location for all programmers to visit
to access all the resources they may need.

The repository should be considered a "living document", i.e. changes will be
made to these resources continuously.
